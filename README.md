<h2 align="center"> 🌏 Welcome to Thibyaa's World 🌏 </h2>

<p align="center"> We're going to start with a fun fact to keep you guys interested...when I'm bored I draw Dragons 🐉 (very random, I know but now you want to see the dragons...right???).

<p align="center"> I'm an aspiring software engineer and I've almost completed my 3 month bootcamp with Bright Network Technology Academy. You'll see all the work in my repositories & these include use of Java, Spring, JavaScript and React. When I'm not studying (but still have capacity to code), I will work on Personal/Commisioned Projects - coming soon...

<p align="center"> However, if you don't find me always learning other wonderful ways to make the world better through coding, you will find me watching Korean Drama (I recommend: Alchemy of Souls...it's on Netflix).
